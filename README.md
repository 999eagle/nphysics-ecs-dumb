Don't use. Work in progress. Many things are incomplete!

TODO sheet from [this nphysics issue](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/issues/149)

- [x] Be able to have something able to simulate one rigid body that falls under gravity. This excludes collision detection, constraint solver, etc.
- [ ] Add support for forces generators.
- [ ] Add support for proxies (which are colliders without contact generation) and proximity detection.
- [ ] Add colliders, without constraints solver.
- [ ] Add support for the constraints solver, but without handling island computation nor body activation/sleeping.
- [ ] Add support for kinematic bodies.
- [ ] Add support for activation/sleeping.
- [ ] Add support for island computation.
- [ ] Add support for joint constraints
